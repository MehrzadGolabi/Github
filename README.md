# MATLAB Teaching Series for Modern Control Theory

A comprehensive educational series of MATLAB scripts designed to teach modern control theory from mathematical foundations to complete observer-based controller implementation.

##  Series Overview

This teaching series consists of **5 seasons** (modules), each building upon the previous one to develop a complete understanding of modern control theory and its implementation in MATLAB.

| Season | Title | Topics | Scripts |
|:------:|:------|:-------|:--------|
| **S01** | Mathematical Foundations | Matrix operations, eigenanalysis, norms, Jordan form, matrix exponential | `S01_Mathematical_Foundations.mlx` |
| **S02** | State-Space Modeling & Linearization | ODEs to state-space, Jacobian linearization, Laplace transforms, system responses | `S02_StateSpace_Modeling_Linearization.mlx` |
| **S03** | Controllability, Observability & Realization | Rank tests, PBH test, gramians, Kalman decomposition, canonical forms, minimal realization | `S03_Controllability_Observability_Realization.mlx` |
| **S04** | Stability, Feedback & LQR | Lyapunov theory, BIBO stability, pole placement, LQR, Riccati equations, digital control | `S04_Stability_Feedback_LQR.mlx` |


##  Learning Objectives

By completing this series, you will be able to:

- Represent physical systems in state-space form
- Linearize nonlinear systems around operating points
- Analyze system controllability and observability
- Assess stability using multiple criteria
- Design state feedback controllers (pole placement and LQR)
- Design full and reduced-order observers
- Implement complete observer-based control systems


## üîß Requirements

### Software
- **MATLAB**: R2025b or later (scripts may work on R2020a+)
- **Required Toolboxes**:
  - Control System Toolbox
  - Symbolic Math Toolbox

### Prerequisites
- **Mathematical Background**:
  - Linear algebra (matrices, eigenvalues, vector spaces)
  - Ordinary differential equations
  - Basic calculus
  
- **MATLAB Skills**:
  - Basic programming (variables, loops, functions)
  - Plotting and visualization
  - Matrix operations

##  How to Use This Series

### Recommended Learning Path

The seasons are designed to be completed **sequentially**:

```
S01 (Foundations) ‚Üí S02 (Modeling) ‚Üí S03 (Structure) ‚Üí S04 (Control)
```

### For Each Season:

1. **Read the header** - Learning outcomes and prerequisites
2. **Run each section** - Execute code sequentially (click "Run Section" in MATLAB)
3. **Study the output** - Observe numerical results and plots
4. **Read the explanations** - Understand theory behind implementation
5. **Try the exercises** - Practice problems at the end
6. **Experiment** - Modify parameters and observe effects
